1: Create a new service account with the name pvviewer. Grant this Service account access to list all PersistentVolumes in the cluster by creating an appropriate cluster role called pvviewer-role and ClusterRoleBinding called pvviewer-role-binding.
Next, create a pod called pvviewer with the image: redis and serviceAccount: pvviewer in the default namespace
H: Hint
Pods authenticate to the API Server using ServiceAccounts. If the serviceAccount name is not specified, the default service account for the namespace is used during a pod creation.

A: 

2: List the InternalIP of all nodes of the cluster. Save the result to a file /root/node_ips
Answer should be in the format: InternalIP of master<space>InternalIP of node1<space>InternalIP of node2<space>InternalIP of node3 (in a single line)
H: Hint
explore the jsonpath loop.
kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}'
A:

3: Create a pod called multi-pod with two containers.
Container 1, name: alpha, image: nginx
Container 2: beta, image: busybox, command sleep 4800.

Environment Variables:
container 1:
name: alpha

Container 2:
name: beta
A:

4: Create a Pod called non-root-pod , image: redis:alpine
runAsUser: 1000
fsGroup: 2000
A:

5: We have deployed a new pod called np-test-1 and a service called np-test-service. Incoming connections to this service are not working. Troubleshoot and fix it.
Create NetworkPolicy, by the name ingress-to-nptest that allows incoming connections to the service over port 80
H: Hint
Create a NetworkPolicy allowing Ingress to np-test-1 pod
Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/
Important: Don't delete any current objects deployed.
A:

6: Taint the worker node node01 to be Unschedulable. Once done, create a pod called dev-redis, image redis:alpine to ensure workloads are not scheduled to this worker node. Finally, create a new pod called prod-redis and image redis:alpine with toleration to be scheduled on node01.
H:Hint
Add a taint to worker node01 and toleration on the pod.
The create pods, prod-redis to be configured with a toleration with the given specs.
Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/
key:env_type, value:production and operator:NoSchedule
A:

7: Create a pod called hr-pod in hr namespace belonging to the production environment and frontend tier .
image: redis:alpine

Use appropriate labels and create all the required objects if it does not exist in the system already.
A:

8: A kubeconfig file called super.kubeconfig has been created in /root. There is something wrong with the configuration. Troubleshoot and fix it.
H: Hint
Verify Host and Port for kube-apiserver are correct
A:

9: A kubeconfig file called super.kubeconfig has been created in /root. There is something wrong with the configuration. Troubleshoot and fix it.
H: Hint
Check the control plane components.
To fix, correct the values in the file and wait for controller-manager pod to restart.
