# 1 Pause the rollout of the deployment

# 2 Create a namespace called 'development' and a pod with image nginx called nginx on this namespace

# 3 Create a redis pod, and have it use a non-persistent storage
(volume that lasts for the lifetime of the Pod)

# 4 Create a deployment of webapp with image nginx:1.17.1 with
container port 80 and verify the image version

# 5 Create a nginx pod with label env=test in engineering namespace

# 6 Make the node schedulable by uncordon the node

# 7 Clean the cluster by deleting deployment and hpa you just created

# 8 expose deployment with “NodePort” service redis-service

# 9 List all configmap and secrets in the cluster in all namespace and write it to a file /opt/configmapsecret

# 10 Create a NetworkPolicy which denies all ingress traffic

# 11 Get the DNS records for the service and pods for the deployment redis and the put the value in /tmp/dnsrecordpod and /tmp/dnsrecord-service

# 12 Get list of all the nodes with labels

# 13 Get the number of schedulable nodes and write to a file /opt/schedulable-nodes.txt

# 14 Create a ETCD backup of kubernetes cluster
Note :You don’t need to memorize command, refer -
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configureupgrade-etcd/ during exam

# 15 Check the history of the specific revision of that deployment

# 16 Update the deployment with the image version 1.16.1 and verify the image and check the rollout history

# 17 Scale down the deployment to 1 replica

# 18 Get list of all the pods showing name and namespace with a jsonpath expression.

# 19 Check logs of each container that “busyboxpod-{1,2,3}”

# 20 Create a PersistentVolumeClaim of at least 3Gi storage and access mode ReadWriteOnce and verify status is Bound

# 21 Print all pod names and all image names and write them to a file named "/opt/pod-details.txt"

# 22 Create a busybox pod and add “sleep 3600” command 

# 23 Get the pods with label env=dev and output the labels

# 24 Get the memory and CPU usage of all the pods and find out top 3 pods which have the highest usage and put them into the cpuusage.txt file
