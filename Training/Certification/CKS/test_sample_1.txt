# 1. You have access to multiple clusters from your main terminal through kubectl contexts. Write all context names into /opt/course/1/contexts, one per line.
From the kubeconfig extract the certificate of user restricted@infra-prod and write it decoded to /opt/course/1/cert.

# 2. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod
Falco is installed with default configuration on node cluster1-worker1. Connect using ssh cluster1-worker1. Use it to:
Find a Pod running image nginx which creates unwanted package management processes inside its container.
Find a Pod running image httpd which modifies /etc/passwd.
Save the Falco logs for case 1 under /opt/course/2/falco.log in format [time][container-id][container-name][user-name]. No other information should be in any line. Collect the logs for at least 30 seconds.
Afterwards remove the threads (both 1 and 2) by scaling the replicas of the Deployments that control the offending Pods down to 0.

# 3. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod

You received a list from the DevSecOps team which performed a security investigation of the k8s cluster1 (workload-prod). The list states the following about the apiserver setup:
- Anonymous access is allowed
- It's accessible on insecure port 8080
- it's accessible through a NodePort Service

Change the apiserver setup so that:
- No anonymous access is allowed
- It's only accessible over HTTPS (disable insecure access)
- It's only accessible through a ClusterIP Service

# 4. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod

There is Deployment docker-log-hacker in Namespace team-red which mounts /var/lib/docker as a hostPath volume on the Node where its running. This means that the Pods can for example read all Docker container logs which are running on the same Node.

You're asked to forbid this behavior by:

Enabling Admission Plugin PodSecurityPolicy in the apiserver
Creating a PodSecurityPolicy named psp-mount which allows hostPath volumes only for directory /tmp
Creating a ClusterRole named psp-mount which allows to use the new PSP
Creating a RoleBinding named psp-mount in Namespace team-red which binds the new ClusterRole to all ServiceAccounts in the Namespace team-red
Restart the Pod of Deployment docker-log-hacker afterwards to verify new creation is prevented.

PSPs can affect the whole cluster. Should you encounter issues you can always disable the Admission Plugin again.

# 5. Use context: kubectl config use-context infra-prod
You're ask to evaluate specific settings of cluster2 against the CIS Benchmark recommendations. Use the tool kube-bench which is already installed on the nodes.

Connect using ssh cluster2-master1 and ssh cluster2-worker1.
On the master node ensure (correct if necessary) that the CIS recommendations are set for:
The --profiling argument of the kube-controller-manager
The ownership of directory /var/lib/etcd

On the worker node ensure (correct if necessary) that the CIS recommendations are set for:
The permissions of the kubelet configuration /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
The --client-ca-file argument of the kubelet

# 6. (can be solved in any kubectl context)
There are four Kubernetes server binaries located at /opt/course/6/binaries. You're provided with the following verified sha512 values for these:
- kube-apiserver f417c0555bc0167355589dd1afe23be9bf909bf98312b1025f12015d1b58a1c62c9908c0067a7764fa35efdac7016a9efa8711a44425dd6692906a7c283f032c

Delete those binaries that don't match with the sha512 values above.

# 7. Use context: kubectl config use-context infra-prod
The Open Policy Agent and Gatekeeper have been installed to, among other things, enforce blacklisting of certain image registries. 
Alter the existing constraint and/or template to also blacklist images from very-bad-registry.com.
Test it by creating a single Pod using image very-bad-registry.com/image in Namespace default, it shouldn't work.
You can also verify your changes by looking at the existing Deployment untrusted in Namespace default, it uses an image from the new untrusted source. 
The OPA constraint should throw violation messages for this one.

# 8. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod
The Kubernetes Dashboard is installed in Namespace kubernetes-dashboard and is configured to:

Allow users to "skip login"
Allow insecure access (HTTP without authentication)
Allow basic authentication
Allow access from outside the cluster
You are asked to make it more secure by:

Deny users to "skip login"
Deny insecure access, enforce HTTPS (self signed certificates are ok for now)
Add the --auto-generate-certificates argument
Enforce authentication using a token (with possibility to use RBAC)
Allow only cluster internal access

# 9. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod
Some containers need to run more secure and restricted. There is an existing AppArmor profile located at /opt/course/9/profile for this.

Install the AppArmor profile on Node cluster1-worker1. Connect using ssh cluster1-worker1.
Add label security=apparmor to the Node
Create a Deployment named apparmor in Namespace default with:
One replica of image nginx:1.19.2
NodeSelector for security=apparmor
Single container named c1 with the AppArmor profile enabled
The Pod might not run properly with the profile enabled. 
Write the logs of the Pod into /opt/course/9/logs so another team can work on getting the application running.

# 10. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod
Team purple wants to run some of their workloads more secure. Worker node cluster1-worker2 has container engine containerd already installed and its configured to support the runsc/gvisor runtime.
The cluster1-worker2 kubelet uses containerd instead of docker. Write the two arguments the kubelet has been configured with to use containerd into /opt/course/10/arguments.
Create a RuntimeClass named gvisor with handler runsc.
Create a Pod that uses the RuntimeClass. The Pod should be in Namespace team-purple, named gvisor-test and of image nginx:1.19.2. Make sure the Pod runs on cluster1-worker2.
Write the dmesg output of the successfully started Pod into /opt/course/10/gvisor-test-dmesg.

# 11. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod
There is an existing Secret called database-access in Namespace team-green.
Read the complete Secret content from ETCD and store it into /opt/course/11/etcd-secret-content. 
Write the plain and decoded Secret's value of key "pass" into /opt/course/11/database-password.

# 12. Use context: kubectl config use-context restricted@infra-prod
You're asked to investigate a possible permission escape in Namespace restricted. 
The context authenticates as user restricted which has only limited permissions and shouldn't be able to read Secret values.
Try to find the password-key values of the Secrets secret1, secret2 and secret3 in Namespace restricted. 
Write the decoded plaintext values into files /opt/course/12/secret1, /opt/course/12/secret2 and /opt/course/12/secret3.

# 13. Use context: kubectl config use-context infra-prod
There is a metadata service available at http://192.168.100.21:32000 on which Nodes can reach sensitive data, like cloud credentials for initialisation. 
By default, all Pods in the cluster also have access to this endpoint. 
The DevSecOps team has asked you to restrict access to this metadata server.
In Namespace metadata-access:
Create a NetworkPolicy named metadata-deny which prevents egress to 192.168.100.21 for all Pods but still allows access to everything else
Create a NetworkPolicy named metadata-allow which allows Pods having label role: metadata-accessor to access endpoint 192.168.100.21
There are existing Pods in the target Namespace with which you can test your policies, but don't change their labels.

# 14. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod
There are Pods in Namespace team-yellow. 
A security investigation noticed that some processes running in these Pods are using the Syscall kill, which is forbidden by a Team Yellow internal policy.
Find the offending Pod(s) and remove these by reducing the replicas of the parent Deployment to 0.

# 15. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod
In Namespace team-pink there is an existing Nginx Ingress resources named secure which accepts two paths /app and /api which point to different ClusterIP Services.
From your main terminal you can connect to it using for example:
HTTP: curl -v http://secure-ingress.test:31080/app
HTTPS: curl -kv https://secure-ingress.test:31443/app
Right now it uses a default generated TLS certificate by the Nginx Ingress Controller.
You're asked to instead use the key and certificate provided at /opt/course/15/tls.key and /opt/course/15/tls.crt. As it's a self-signed certificate you need to use curl -k when connecting to it.

# 16. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod
There is a Deployment image-verify in Namespace team-blue which runs image registry.killer.sh:5000/image-verify:v1. DevSecOps has asked you to improve this image by:

Changing the base image to alpine:3.12
Not installing curl
Updating nginx to version >=1.18.0
Running the main process as user myuser
Do not add any new lines to the Dockerfile, just edit existing ones. The file is located at /opt/course/16/image/Dockerfile.

Tag your version as v2. You can build, tag and push using:

cd /opt/course/16/image
sudo docker build -t registry.killer.sh:5000/image-verify:v2 .
sudo docker run registry.killer.sh:5000/image-verify:v2 # to test your changes
sudo docker push registry.killer.sh:5000/image-verify:v2
Make the Deployment use your updated image tag v2.

# 17. Use context: kubectl config use-context infra-prod
Audit Logging has been enabled in the cluster with an Audit Policy located at /etc/kubernetes/audit/policy.yaml on cluster2-master1.
Change the configuration so that only one backup of the logs is stored.
Alter the Policy in a way that it only stores logs:
From Secret resources, level Metadata
From "system:nodes" userGroups, level RequestResponse
After you altered the Policy make sure to empty the log file so it only contains entries according to your changes, like using truncate -s 0 /etc/kubernetes/audit/logs/audit.log .

# 18. Use context: kubectl config use-context infra-prod
Namespace security contains five Secrets of type Opaque which can be considered highly confidential. 
The latest Incident-Prevention-Investigation revealed that ServiceAccount p.auster had too broad access to the cluster for some time. 
This SA should've never had access to any Secrets in that Namespace.
Find out which Secrets in Namespace security this SA did access by looking at the Audit Logs under /opt/course/18/audit.log.
Change the password to any new string of only those Secrets that were accessed by this SA.

# 19. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-prod
The Deployment immutable-deployment in Namespace team-purple should run immutable, it's created from file /opt/course/19/immutable-deployment.yaml. 
Even after a successful break-in, it shouldn't be possible for an attacker to modify the filesystem of the running container.
Modify the Deployment in a way that no processes inside the container can modify the local filesystem, only /tmp directoy should be writeable. 
Don't modify the Docker image.
Save the updated YAML under /opt/course/19/immutable-deployment-new.yaml and update the running Deployment.

# 20. Use context: kubectl config use-context workload-stage
The cluster is running Kubernetes 1.18.6. Update it to 1.19.4 available via apt package manager.
Use ssh cluster3-master1 and ssh cluster3-worker1 to connect to the instances.

# 21. (can be solved in any kubectl context)
The Vulnerability Scanner trivy is installed on your main terminal. Use it to scan the following images for known CVEs:
- nginx:1.16.1-alpine
- k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver:v1.18.0
- k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager:v1.18.0
- docker.io/weaveworks/weave-kube:2.7.0
Write all images that don't contain the vulnerabilities CVE-2020-10878 or CVE-2020-1967 into /opt/course/21/good-images.

# 22. (can be solved in any kubectl context)
The Release Engineering Team has shared some YAML manifests and Dockerfiles with you to review. 
The files are located under /opt/course/22/files.
As a container security expert, you are asked to perform a manual static analysis and find out possible security issues with respect to unwanted credential exposure.
Write the filenames which have issues into /opt/course/22/security-issues.
NOTE: In the Dockerfile and YAML manifests, assume that the referred files, folders, secrets and volume mounts are present. Disregard syntax or logic errors.
